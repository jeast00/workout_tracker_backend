# Workout Tracker

Workout Tracker is an application to track your workouts.

## Installation

There will be two repositories needed for this program; workout_tracker_backend and workout_tracker_frontend.  The frontend javascript client repository will be found here:

https://github.com/jeast00/workout_tracker_frontend

Once both repositories have been cloned, use your favorite IDE and pull up the terminal to load both repos.  

## Usage

The usage for this application is strictly html (index.html).  The backend will need the rails server command in the terminal.  

The index.html page will be located where you cloned the repository.  You will need to open that file on your web browser of choice (I would prefer Goggle Chrome).

Add the name of the workout and then the user can add the name of the exercise, sets, repetitions, and time completed.  The user can also delete the entire workout and enter again.
